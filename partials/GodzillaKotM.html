<p>1954 was an extremely good year for cinema. It gave birth to classics like Seven Samurai, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Sabrina, Rear Window, Them!, and The Creature From the Black Lagoon. With Godzilla, it also set film on a path that would take many twists and turns over the next 60 years, from criticizing the hubris of man, to over the top childlike spectacle, but always with a love for the art of special effects. Godzilla isn’t about having the best effects in town, but for having a grounded, practical, and immediately recognizable style. Godzilla’s signature suitmation style eschewed the popular stop-motion animation of the time, and generally steered clear of the computer animation trend of the 90s and beyond. Eiji Tsubaraya’s choice to put a man in a suit may have been a cost and time saving measure, but it inspired an entire genre that gave us Gamera, Rodan, Ultraman, and the Power Rangers. And we’re still making these films! It’s a testament to the amount of passion that SFX trailblazers put into these movies that Godzilla’s legacy survives today.</p>

<p>The original Godzilla isn’t on many lists of top movies in history, whether you’re judging by popular voting on IMDB and rotten tomatoes, or put together by the American Film Institute. But truth be told, it’s a film that’s more rewatchable than Citizen Kane. Full disclosure, Citizen Kane is definitely a film you should watch once, but in my opinion isn’t half the movie that Casablanca is. 1954’s Godzilla succeeds on many levels, structurally, technically, and influentially. It packs an emotional punch dealing with physical and emotional fallout of the nuclear atrocities 10 year prior, but still manages to showcase a thrilling rampage that you can’t help but love.</p>

<p>Godzilla doesn’t pull any punches in its critique of the atomic bomb. He’s a creature twisted, scarred, and mutated by nuclear testing, literally the embodiment of the unintended consequences of science. If this is your jam, you are in for a ride. Everything about Godzilla’s design represents the power of nature and emphasizes the folly of man. He’s built like a brick shithouse, has more spines than anything seen in alive, and even the texture of the suit is meant to look like horrible radiation scarring. The director practically screams at the audience “LOOK WHAT HORRORS WE HAVE WROUGHT!” when scientists take off-the-charts geiger readings on children in the wake of Godzilla’s destruction. During the final attack, a mother tries to console her child by saying “We’ll be joining your father in just a moment! Just a little longer and we’ll be with daddy!” You won’t find a more ham-fisted portrayal of devastation in any of the 28 films to follow.</p>

<p>As far as story goes, it’s not terrible. It fits a fairly formulaic structure of science fiction films of the era. Story in pretty much any Godzilla flick is a thin gossamer draped over some standard-issue scaffolding that exists solely to fill time between Godzilla jacking up Tokyo. You’re not going to watch many of these for their memorable characters, you’re going to watch some tanks melt and some buildings get stomped. The best ones use this knowledge to go to some really outlandish places, but in 1954, they weren’t aware that they were going to be part of something bigger and played things pretty safe. There’s some young love between Ogata and Emiko, some arrogance of man in Dr. Yamane, and some sense of mystery and sacrifice in Dr. Serizawa. While it’s easy to criticize the plot device of a literal device with unintended side-effects being the thing used to destroy Godzilla, the Oxygen Destroyer is actually a much smarter idea than it seems at first glance. Dr. Serizawa creates it, but discovers that it will destroy all life in water, and keeps researching because he feels it could somehow, someday benefit humanity. It reminds me of Dr. Venture showcasing his city-melting “Oo-Ray” that could have “all kinds of positive applications!” But it turns out, there IS a huge demand for a device that strips dissolved oxygen from water, and that device is the only reason I’m able to deliver this blog to you today: the silicon chip. Silicon is given a mechanical and chemical polishing to smooth out the wafers, and the more tiny and detailed  our circuits get, the more perfect the polish has to be. When rinsing the wafers, this necessitates higher standards in water purity devoid of particles, minerals, and even dissolved gasses. Dissolved oxygen can create bubbles and irregular coating in the wash. So thanks, Dr. Serizawa. Your Oxygen Destroyer, while not immediately disintegrating all life within water, is now the basis for technology used in every industry on the planet today.</p>

<p>The real strength in this film comes from director Ishiro Honda and effects artist Eiji Tsubraya’s grasp of film as an artistic medium. The visuals they paint with Godzilla’s wake of destruction, described as a “sea of fire,” the shots of a discarded guitar and overturned go board immediately humanzing the Japanese military in a time where American audiences and Japanese society were both fearful of armed Japan, and the focus on the aftermath of the attacks and how it affects the survivors and the nation as a whole. The sound engineering ascribes an iconic scream to Godzilla that sounds more like steal being bent and torn than the roar of a living creature. The score of the film varying the main theme from ambitious and triumphant when making military preparations to grim and clumsy when the attack on Tokyo is under way. It almost sounds like someone in a rubber suit clomping around on piano keys in those moments.</p>

<p>Really the only major weakness of the film is that in some shots when we see a closeup of Godzilla peering over a mountaintop or cityscape, a puppet was used. I don’t know what kind of limitations, or miscommunications, or rushed design and production led to this, but the effect is not good. His face looks like an oatmeal raisin cookie with teeth. It looks like it has sticky googly eyes plastered on it. The head seems to large in proportion to its neck and the arms have none of the beefy power behind them that the suit has. This puppet is the least intimidating thing you’ll ever see, and, unfortunately inspires the 60s era Godzilla suit featured in some of the most asinine entries in the series. </p>

<p>While not a fault of the original, there is also the matter of the American edit. The American edit adds the “King of the Monsters” tagline and a whole new character, Steve Martin (no relation). Raymond Burr’s rendition of the American reporter Martin is actually pretty good, and his lines bring a sad poetry to the film that the original script was lacking. But he’s there for one reason: to give American audiences a character to relate to. The entire plot is seen through Steve’s eyes, and relayed through his words. There’s little actual dialogue from the original that’s kept in this version. In one scene, after Emiko is distraught, she decides to confide in American Reporter Steve Martin rather than her own fiance. Ogata really gets the shaft in this edit, not that he was a huge influence to begin with. It’s a reminder of America’s ugly past, our inability to relate to non-white humans and treat them as such. It’s a leftover dissonance that allowed us to corral Japanese Americans into internment camps during the war. Ten years later, Japan is still dealing with radiation sickness from the destruction we caused, and we are still dealing with our own cultural sickness that prevents us from viewing the Japanese as real, relatable, human beings.</p>
